**Features:**

**Login Form**: The project includes a simple login form UI implemented using Spring MVC.

**Data Modeling**: It showcases the process of transferring data between the View and Controller layers efficiently using Model and View classes.

**Controller Logic**: The controller class is responsible for handling incoming requests, processing data, and preparing the response to be sent back to the client.

**Request Parameter Annotation**: Utilizes the @RequestParam annotation for mapping request parameters to method parameters in the controller.
